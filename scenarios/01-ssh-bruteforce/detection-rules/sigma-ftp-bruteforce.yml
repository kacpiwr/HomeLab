    ## 1. Objective
    The goal of this lab was to simulate brutte force attack to the host  and verify if the SIEM (Splunk) could detect the generated network noise.

    ## 2. MITRE ATT&CK Brute Force Technique 
    * **Tactic:** Credential Access (TA0006)
    * **Technique:** Brute Force (T1110)
    * **Procedure:** Using `Hydra` to brute-force FTP password on a target machine for msfadmin.

    ---

    ## 3. Red Team Operations (Attack Simulation)
    **Tools used:** Hydra
    **Target:** Ubuntu Server Metasploitable (192.168.1.113)

    ### Execution
    The following command was executed to initiate the activity:

    ```bash
    hydra-l msfadmin -p passlist.txt ftp://192.168.1.113
    ```

    Observation: Program tried multiple password combinations from the provided list against the FTP service on the target machine for known admin login.

    4. Blue Team Operations (Detection & Analysis)

    Tool: Splunk Enterprise Log Source: var/log/syslog
    Detection Logic (SPL)

    To detect this activity, I used the following Splunk search query:
    Fragment kodu

    ```spl
    index=metasploitable host="192.168.1.113" | where number_of_tries > 250
    ````

    Analysis Breakdown

        index=metasploitable: Defines the data scope.

        host="192.168.1.113": Filters logs for the target host.

        where number_of_tries > 250: Identifies instances where the number of login attempts exceeds 250, indicating potential brute-force activity.

        Threshold: Set to 250 attempts to minimize false positives while effectively capturing brute-force attempts.

    5. Business Impact & Mitigation

        Risk: Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, leading to potential data breaches, service disruptions, and financial losses.

        Mitigation: Implement strickter frewall rules, enforce stronger password policies and disable unused services.

    6. Lessons Learned

        Learned how flags work in hydra tool, how to create custom detection rules in Splunk and the importance of monitoring login attempts to identify potential security threats.
